<h1>Conway's Game of Life</h1> 

<h3>Overview</h3>
For my final project, I want to simulate Conway's Game of Life. The game simulates the life cycles of a group of square cells on a 2D plane. A cell's life depends on the 8 cells that surround it. If between 2 and 3 cells of the 8 neighboring cells are alive and the cell is alive, the cell continues to live. Otherwise, the cell dies. If exactly 3 neighboring cells are alive, the cell comes to life. The result creates really cool animations, and I want to see if I can create some of those displays with what I've learned this semester.

<h3>Timeline</h3>
By the end of Week 1, I want to have a basic simulation with a single digit number of cells working. I'd like to have started working on getting larger configurations working. By the end of Week 2, I want different configurations (this should be randomized) to pop up each time the program is run. I should have started on getting users to click and add cells. By the end of Week 3, I would have finished the implementation for users to click and add cells.

<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
If I had time, I'd have a user choose which random configuration they could display. They might also be able to introduce special cells which act as predators, killing any neighboring cell. I could also have users introduce a "diseased cell", represented by a different color, and see how far the disease spreads.
